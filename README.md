## 🧠 Model

- **Backbone**: `ResNet18` from `torchvision.models`
- **Classifier**: Final FC layer replaced with `nn.Linear(in_features, 5)`
- **Pretrained**: ImageNet weights used for transfer learning

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/satviknight/soil-classification.git
cd soil-classification

# (Recommended) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # or `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Training
To train the model from scratch or fine-tune it:

Place your dataset in the proper structure as described above.

Open and run all cells in notebooks/training.ipynb.

The best model will be saved as best_model.pth.

🔍 Inference
To generate predictions on the test set:

Make sure best_model.pth is available (from training).

Open and run all cells in notebooks/inference.ipynb.

The output file submission.csv will be created.
